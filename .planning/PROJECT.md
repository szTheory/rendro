# Rendro

## What This Is

Rendro is a pure-Elixir, Phoenix-first PDF and document generation library for teams that need deterministic, production-grade output without depending on a browser runtime in core. It focuses on predictable layout and pagination for real business artifacts like invoices, statements, certificates, and reporting documents. The primary users are Phoenix SaaS engineers, back-office/reporting engineers, and operators who need trustworthy behavior under production load.

## Core Value

Phoenix teams can generate reliable, auditable, deterministic PDFs from Elixir data/components, with clear pagination behavior and production-grade observability.

## Current State

**Shipped Version:** v2.1 Cryptographic Signing & Signed-Artifact Proof (2026-05-07)

Rendro now supports one proof-backed cryptographic-signing path over the shipped unsigned/preparation seam: `Rendro.Sign.sign/2` signs rendered artifacts, first-party optional pyHanko and pdfsig adapters keep runtime-executable and integrity-vs-trust boundaries explicit, and the live proof lane is both executable and enforced on `main` through the required `signing-live-proof` status check. The public support contract now distinguishes signed-artifact integrity from certificate trust, viewer posture, and deferred compliance narratives, and the closeout trail includes Phase 60-63 verification artifacts for full audit-grade requirement closure.

**Previous Shipped Version:** v2.0 Signature Fields & External Signing Preparation (2026-05-07)

Rendro now supports explicit unsigned signature-field authoring through `Rendro.signature_field/2`, deterministic unsigned `/Sig` widget serialization on the existing AcroForm seam, and artifact-first external-signing preparation through `Rendro.Sign.prepare/2`. The public support contract now names unsigned widgets and signing preparation separately from unsupported digital-signature, viewer-validity, tamper-evidence, and compliance claims, and the closeout trail now includes backfilled Phase 55 and 56 verification artifacts so requirement closure is audit-grade rather than summary-only.

**Previous Shipped Version:** v1.10 Protected Delivery Hooks & Encryption Boundaries (2026-05-06)

Rendro now supports artifact-first password-to-open protection through `Rendro.Protect` and the first-party optional `qpdf` adapter, with AES-256-only public semantics, password-safe error/audit boundaries, password-aware Poppler structural validation, proof-backed Apple Preview support for the `protection` surface, and release-readiness gates that keep the canonical protected-delivery recipe truthful.

**Previous Shipped Version:** v1.9 Embedded Artifact Surfaces (2026-05-06)

Rendro supports document-level embedded files with explicit, deterministic metadata and curated link annotations limited to `http`/`https` URIs and in-document page targets. The writer emits deterministic `/EmbeddedFile`, `/Filespec`, `/Names`, and `/AF` catalog wiring and serializes `/Link` annotations through the existing page `/Annots` seam without named destinations or generic action dictionaries. Public claims are backed by structural proof through Poppler and recorded manual viewer evidence in Adobe Acrobat Reader and Apple Preview.

**Previous Shipped Version:** v1.8 Interactive PDF Forms (2026-05-05)

Rendro supports deterministic authored AcroForm text fields, checkboxes, and radio groups in the core pipeline with explicit appearance streams and proof-backed forms support boundaries.

**Previous Shipped Version:** v1.5 Validation and Trust Surfaces (2026-05-05)

Rendro provides validator-backed trust surfaces including the `Poppler` adapter for structural validation and a machine-readable support matrix for clear operational boundaries.

**Previous Shipped Version:** v1.4 Async Delivery and Artifact Operations (2026-05-05)

Rendro ships a queued render lifecycle, artifact metadata, persistence/sink contracts, and optional integrations (`Accrue`, `Mailglass`, `Oban.RenderWorker`) for production async/delivery workflows.

**Foundation Already Shipped:** v1.3 release readiness, v1.2 typography/assets truth, v1.1 layout-authoring maturity, and v1.0 deterministic core rendering.

## Current Milestone

No milestone is active right now. `v2.1` is shipped and archived; the next milestone should be defined fresh before more scoped implementation work begins.

## Next Milestone Goals

**Next candidate:** post-`v2.1` long-lived signatures and compliance evidence

**Direction:**
- Keep any follow-on signature work narrower than blanket trust or compliance positioning.
- Add timestamp, revocation, and long-lived-signature proof only through explicit validator-backed artifact lanes.
- Continue promoting signed-PDF viewer support only through recorded proof and support-matrix updates.

### Active

- [ ] Define the next milestone through fresh context, requirements, and roadmap artifacts before starting new implementation work.
- [ ] Keep any future signature work narrower than blanket trust or compliance claims unless a proof-backed milestone explicitly closes those gaps.
- [ ] Continue promoting signed-PDF viewer support only through recorded proof and support-matrix updates.

### Out of Scope

- HTML/CSS parity or browser-style layout behavior — Rendro remains a deterministic document engine, not a browser renderer.
- WYSIWYG builders, hosted template editing, or app-specific layout hacks in core — they widen surface area before the authoring contract is stable.
- In-core key custody, certificate-store management, HSM orchestration, or signer identity workflows — these belong to optional adapters or external infrastructure.
- PAdES/LTV/TSA/OCSP/CRL and blanket compliance claims — require dedicated later proof and a narrower public narrative than `v2.1`.
- Generic "signed PDF works everywhere" positioning — viewer promotion stays evidence-gated per viewer and surface.
- Remote asset fetching, broad complex-script support, and "supports every language" positioning — defer until the engine has proof surfaces for them.

## Context

Rendro has now shipped four authored PDF surfaces inside one deterministic pipeline: static content (v1.0-v1.2), interactive forms (v1.8), document-level embedded files (v1.9), and curated link annotations (v1.9). `v1.10`, `v2.0`, and now `v2.1` prove that trust-sensitive capabilities can land through artifact-first or optional-adapter seams without widening the core rendering contract: protection shipped through `Rendro.Protect`, unsigned signature preparation shipped through `Rendro.Sign.prepare/2`, and cryptographic signing shipped through `Rendro.Sign.sign/2` plus first-party optional runtime adapters.

The next step, if warranted, should build on this proof-backed seam rather than reopening it: long-lived evidence, timestamp/revocation narratives, and narrower compliance stories should come only after explicit validator-backed artifact proof exists.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Keep the core pure Elixir with no hard dependency on Phoenix, Oban, browser runtimes, Python packages, or external signing binaries — preserves deterministic deployment and product boundaries.
- **Architecture**: Extend the existing `build -> compose -> measure -> paginate -> render -> validate` pipeline instead of creating an alternate rendering path — one engine must continue to power both APIs.
- **Product scope**: Cryptographic signing must stay narrower than certificate trust, viewer promotion, or compliance narratives unless a later milestone proves those separately.
- **Determinism**: Unsigned render output remains deterministic; signed output is intentionally non-deterministic and must be labeled as such rather than hidden behind deterministic claims.
- **Operational safety**: Key paths, passphrases, raw tool stderr, and signer-specific secrets must stay redacted in errors, metadata, and audit surfaces.
- **Documentation honesty**: Public APIs, guides, and examples must not imply viewer support, trust anchoring, or compliance coverage beyond what `priv/support_matrix.json` and proof lanes cover.
- **Verification**: Merge-blocking, docs-contract, structural-validation, and live-tool proof lanes must stay truthful as the signing surface expands.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Embedded files live on the document in a dedicated registry, not on `metadata.custom` or in writer-owned state | Preserves the registry-backed authored-input pattern and keeps serialization separate from authoring state | ✓ Shipped in v1.9 |
| Embedded-file metadata is validated in `Rendro.Pipeline.Validate` with tuple errors, not registration-time exceptions | Keeps malformed authored state in the standard validate-stage error envelope before writer work begins | ✓ Shipped in v1.9 |
| Embedded files extend the existing writer allocation/build funnel; no inline serializer or separate PDF surface | Preserves one deterministic object-planning seam in the core writer | ✓ Shipped in v1.9 |
| Attachment catalog wiring stays document-level only (`/Names`, `/EmbeddedFiles`, `/AF`); no page-level file-attachment annotations | Matches the phase threat model and prevents generic-annotation scope creep | ✓ Shipped in v1.9 |
| Curated links accept only explicit `uri:` (`http`/`https`) or `page:` targets; no named destinations, no `/GoToR`, no generic actions | Narrowest useful annotation surface that reuses the existing `/Annots` seam without opening a generic review/comment API | ✓ Shipped in v1.9 |
| Hold viewer claims at `unverified` until manual evidence is recorded; promote only proof-backed pairs at milestone close | Keeps the public support contract truthful and auditable; prevents portability overclaims | ✓ Shipped in v1.9 |
| Reuse one `Rendro.form_field/3` / `%Rendro.FormField{}` authored boundary for all currently supported interactive widgets | Keeps DSL surface area narrow and preserves one normalization path into the core engine | ✓ Shipped in v1.8 |
| Generate explicit form appearance streams instead of relying on `NeedAppearances` | Viewer-generated appearances would weaken determinism and create false portability claims | ✓ Shipped in v1.8 |
| Publish support boundaries as machine-readable product contract | Viewer and feature claims need one canonical truth source that docs and tests can enforce | ✓ Shipped in v1.5 and extended in v1.8/v1.9/v2.0 |
| Preserve the core/adapter split even as operational features grow | Keeps Rendro deployable and testable without forcing downstream ecosystem choices | ✓ Reinforced across v1.4 through v2.0 |
| Treat verification artifacts as product behavior | Operators need clear proof of what the engine supports and what remains unverified | ✓ Reinforced across shipped milestones |
| `v2.1` proved one narrow cryptographic-signing path before any compliance or long-lived-signature stories | Protected the product contract from widening faster than the evidence lanes could support it | ✓ Shipped in v2.1 |

<details>
<summary>v1.10 milestone focus before ship</summary>

- Add a truthful protection story through external hooks first, with password-to-open and advisory-permissions claims kept narrow.
- Add proof-backed structural validation and protected-artifact-safe delivery/storage seams.
- Defer native encryption, signatures, and compliance narratives until later proof-backed milestones.

</details>

## Evolution Path

- `v2.0` shipped signature preparation through narrow authored fields and external-signing seams, not broad cryptographic or compliance claims.
- `v2.1` added actual cryptographic signing and signed-artifact proof without collapsing integrity, trust, viewer posture, and compliance into one claim.
- A post-`v2.1` milestone, if warranted, should add long-lived-signature evidence and compliance narratives only after the signing seam is stable and explicitly proof-backed.
- The core deterministic pipeline and the optional-adapter boundary remain non-negotiable.
